# Brave-Butters-Kelley Indexes (BBKI)

The [Brave-Butters-Kelley Indexes (BBKI)](https://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/bbki/) developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the IU Kelley School of Business are barometers of where the economy is and where it might be heading in the future.

This data set summarizes 490 macroeconomic time series extending back to 1960 to generate a **coincident index** that provides a snapshot of the current state of the economy, a **leading index** that looks toward the future, and **monthly gross domestic product (GDP)** growth estimates.


## The coincident index
The coincident index addresses the question: "Where are we?"

It is measured in standard deviation units and assesses the current strength of the economy. Using a threshold value of -1.0, provides a remarkably accurate (up to 99% accurate) way to gauge whether the economy is in a recession. This accuracy in gauging the strength of the economy has been shown to best many of the leading alternatives and can often come in a much timelier fashion given that the BBKI is released monthly.

## The leading index
The leading index addresses the question: Where are we going?

It is a sub-component of the coincident index that isolates the economic activity that has historically been a leading signal of the trajectory of economic activity going forward. This leading index has on several occasions projected a future business cycle turning point several months before a peak or trough actually occurs — historically being the most informative about six to seven months out.

## Monthly GDP growth
Each month, real GDP growth is allowed to have three separate components - each with their own separate type of dynamics - that all must add up to yield the total amount of growth or contraction.

- Trend: This represents the very low-frequency and slow-moving component of real GDP growth. One can interpret it as the very long-run average of real GDP growth. While the trend component does not vary that much month to month, over the last several decades we have seen a noticeable decline in the long-run average of real GDP growth.

- Cycle: This is the component of real GDP growth that reflects the business cycle. It is designed to capture systematic expansions or contractions across a variety of sectors of the economy. It is the cycle component that in many instances will be the most influential in guiding assessments about the health of the economy and public policy decisions designed to address it.

- Irregular: This component is what remains “left over,” after accounting for the trend and cycle components, to get back to the amount of growth or contraction we observed. While the BBKI methodology is designed to have the trend and cycle components reflect movements that are likely to govern the direction of growth going forward, the irregular component is designed to reflect more “one-off” or random fluctuations that are less likely to reflect where economic activity is headed in the future.
