# New York Fed Weekly Economic Index (WEI)

The New York Fed's [Weekly Economic Index (WEI)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/weekly-economic-index#/) is an index of real economic activity using timely and relevant high-frequency data. It represents the **common component** of **ten different daily and weekly series** covering consumer behavior, the labor market, and production. The WEI is **scaled to the four-quarter GDP growth rate**; for example, if the WEI reads -2 percent and the current level of the WEI persists for an entire quarter, one would expect, on average, GDP that quarter to be 2 percent lower than a year previously.

The 10 weekly economic indicators are:
