# OECD Weekly Tracker of Economic Activity

The [OECD Weekly Tracker of GDP growth](https://www.oecd.org/economy/weekly-tracker-of-gdp-growth/) provides a real-time high-frequency indicator of economic activity using machine learning and Google Trends data. 

It has a wide country coverage of OECD and G20 countries. The Tracker is thus particularly well suited to assessing activity when it is changing very rapidly due to the impact of a major shock. It applies a machine learning model to a panel of Google Trends data for 46 countries, and aggregates together information about search behavior related to consumption, labor markets, housing, trade, industrial activity and economic uncertainty (see [Working paper](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/tracking-activity-in-real-time-with-google-trends_6b9c7518-en)).

There are two series of the Weekly Tracker:

The **GDP growth Tracker (yoy)** provides estimates of weekly GDP relative to the same week in the previous year. It covers the period from early 2020 to today.

The **GDP level Tracker** provides estimates of the level of weekly GDP relative to 2019 Q4. It covers the period from early 2004 to today. Its methodology is described in [this note](https://www.oecd.org/economy/outlook/Note-on-Tracker-of-GDP-Level.pdf).
Each series has its own 95% confidence intervals (lower and higher bands).

Please note these are not official OECD forecasts, which are most recently published in the OECD Economic Outlook. However, the Tracker is one of several indicators that feeds into the OECD forecast process, which helps to situate the current state of the economy.
