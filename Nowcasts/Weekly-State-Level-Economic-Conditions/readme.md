# Baumeister, Leiva-León, and Sims Weekly State-Level Economic Conditions Indicators

The [Weekly State-Level Economic Conditions Indicators](https://sites.google.com/view/weeklystateindexes/dashboard) are computed with mixed-frequency dynamic factor models with weekly, monthly, and quarterly variables that cover multiple dimensions of state economies (see [Baumeister, Leiva-León and Sims, 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TX9Y8kMMkrHo1MBGVHQ0vxs6VFgEoMWK/view)). The indices are scaled to 4-quarter growth rates of U.S. real GDP and normalized such that a value of zero indicates national long-run growth. The gray shaded areas indicate NBER recessions.
