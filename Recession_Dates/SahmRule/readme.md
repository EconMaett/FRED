# Sahm Rule Recession Indicator

The Sahm Rule Recession Indicator was invented by the ass-kicking [Prof. Claudia Sahm](https://sites.google.com/site/claudiasahm/) while working as Section Chief at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

It was first proposed as an automatic stabiliser in ["Direct Stimulus Payments to Individuals" (2019)](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/Sahm_web_20190506.pdf). In Recession Ready: Fiscal Policies to Stabilize the American Economy, edited by Heather Boushey, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh. Washington, DC: The Hamilton Project and the Washington Center on Equitable Growth.

You may learn more about Prof. Sahm's work on her [MacroMom Blog](https://macromomblog.com/) or on her [Stay-at-Home-Macro Substack](https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/).

Her [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sahm) and that of [the epinomous indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahm_Rule) are definitely worth a visit as well.

Currently, there are two versions of the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator published on FRED: 

1. Sahm Recession Indicator ("SAHMCURRENT") signals the start of a recession when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate (U3) rises by 0.50 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months.

2. The "SAHMREALTIME" indicator works accordingly but is based on "real-time" data, that is, the unemployment rate (and the recent history of unemployment rates) that were available in a given month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revises the unemployment rate each year at the beginning of January, when the December unemployment rate for the prior year is published. Revisions to the seasonal factors can affect estimates in recent years. Otherwise the unemployment rate does not revise.
